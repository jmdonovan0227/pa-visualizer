# Maze Pathfinder
  ## Description
  - Maze Pathfinder is a maze-solving web application. Users can
  generate random mazes between dimensions of 5x5 up to 50x50.
  By default, mazes are generated with dimensions of 20x20. To
  solve mazes, the application has two options which are
  breadth-first search and depth-first search. While solving
  the mazes, paths will change colors to provide a visual
  representation of how bfs and dfs are solving the mazes. As
  a little extra, I also added a very quiet clicking noise
  while the algorithms are solving the maze and a message when
  the maze has been solved.
